Dear <%= name.capitalize %>,

Christmas is coming! My elves are busy getting everything ready for the holiday. (Except for Merton the Elf. He comes in late and leaves early and thinks I don’t know. Ha! Santa SEES ALL! )

Anyway, thank you for your letter. It was very kind of you to include a cookie in the envelope. FYI, cookies do not travel well and it was a handful of crumbs by the time it arrived. I still ate it. Santa has no shame.

Once I was done, I read your letter. You have quite a list of toys!

<% toys.each do |toy| -%>
  - <%= toy %>
<% end -%>

I’ve been watching you all year and I follow you on Facebook and Twitter. You’ve been a very good kid. That’s why you’re on my nice list.

<% if toys.include?('Kaleidoscope') -%>
You know what that means! It means you’re getting everything you want! Well, almost.

Unfortunately, Merton messed up the Kaleidoscope order and the shipment won’t arrive until January. We’re substituting your Kaleidoscope, with a picture of a whale.
<% else -%>
This year you're getting all the toys on your list!
<% end -%>

Happy Christmas!

Santa Claus
