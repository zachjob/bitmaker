# The Reactor is what powers the ship.
# It uses dilithium crystals as its fuel.
# If it runs out of dilithium crystals, the power is turned off.
# The Replicator and Transporter both rely on the
# Reactor for power.

# It's also responsbile for heating
# and cooling the glass.

# If it's working properly, when it's instantiated
# the power should be turned on and it should be
# stocked with @dilithium_crystals
