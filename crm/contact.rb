class Contact

  # This method should initialize the contact's attributes
  def initialize

  end

  # This method should call the initializer, 
  # store the newly created contact, and then return it
  def self.create

  end

  # This method should return all of the existing contacts
  def self.all

  end

  # This method should accept an id as an argument
  # and return the contact who has that id
  def self.find

  end

  # This method should allow you to specify 
  # 1. which of the contact's attributes you want to update
  # 2. the new value for that attribute
  # and then make the appropriate change to the contact
  def update

  end

  # This method should work similarly to the find method above
  # but it should allow you to search for a contact using attributes other than id
  # by specifying both the name of the attribute and the value
  # eg. searching for 'first_name', 'Betty' should return the first contact named Betty
  def self.find_by

  end

  # This method should delete all of the contacts
  def self.delete_all

  end

  def full_name

  end

  # This method should delete the contact
  # HINT: Check the Array class docs for built-in methods that might be useful here
  def delete

  end

  # Feel free to add other methods here, if you need them.
