Dear Dale,

Christmas is coming! My elves are busy getting everything ready for the holiday. (Except for Merton the Elf. He comes in late and leaves early and thinks I don’t know. Ha! Santa SEES ALL! )

Anyway, thank you for your letter. It was very kind of you to include a cookie in the envelope. FYI, cookies do not travel well and it was a handful of crumbs by the time it arrived. I still ate it. Santa has no shame.

Once I was done, I read your letter. You have quite a list of toys!

  - Truck
  - Barbie
  - Slinky
  - Crayons
  - Doll
  - Dominoes

I’ve been watching you all year and I follow you on Facebook and Twitter. You’ve been a very good kid. That’s why you’re on my nice list.

This year you're getting all the toys on your list!

Happy Christmas!

Santa Claus
